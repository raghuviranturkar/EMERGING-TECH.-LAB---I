# üìä EMERGING TECH. LAB - I (Data Science and Statistics)

Welcome to the **Emerging Tech Lab - I** repository!  
This lab is focused on learning the **fundamentals of data science, statistics**, and **machine learning** using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.

Throughout this lab, we explore data manipulation, statistical analysis, and core machine learning algorithms. The lab exercises are implemented using popular Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
